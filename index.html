				<h1>WELCOME TO KATHMANDU</h1>
				<p>
					The largest city and capital of Nepal and the namesake of the Kathmandu Valley. Once thought to be the fabled and inaccessible Shangri-La, Kathmandu is now a hub for independent travellers as well as a growing vacation spot catering to all budgets. As a result of considerable urban growth in recent decades, it is now part of one continuous urban area together with Patan to the south.

			<h1>Things To Do In Kathmandu:</h1>
			<div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 about">
				<h3>Visit to Thamel</h3>
				<img src="images/ktm-2.jpg" alt="ktm-2">
				<p>
					When looking for things to do in Kathmandu, and you’re unsure of where to start, go to Thamel. This part of Kathmandu is the heart and soul of the chaos. Shops and markets open from dusk till dawn, tourists and locals intermingling and the sheer volume of- well… everything, will overwhelm the senses. There is an excess of all things imaginable; souvenirs, knockoffs, groceries, restaurants, tattoo parlors, tour companies etc. Walking in this dusty labyrinth of colour, you can find hidden treasures of all sorts. Be it a roof top patio, or just a hidden alley with the best deals in town.

				<h3>Pasupatinath Temple</h3>
				<img src="images/ktm-3.jpg" alt="ktm-3">
				<p>
					For me, this was one of the trip highlights. It is one of the most culturally interesting places I have recently visited, and as long as you go with an open mind, and a respect for tradition, this could really be an eye opener. In Kathmandu this is one of the most significant Hindu temples, which is placed on the Bagmati River. The area seems to hold many smaller temples, which are frequented by Sadhus (Holy Men). I think they may have been the most exciting part for me, such interesting people. What I found most interesting were the cremations though.

				<h3>Garden Of Dreams</h3>
				<img src="images/ktm-4.jpg" alt="ktm-4">
				<p>
					I did not personally go to this garden. However I hear it is a beautiful garden in the midst of the craziness of Kathmandu. Inside the garden you will find European style landscaping and architecture, which is a great juxtaposition to what is just outside the fence. Undergoing renovations in the past few years, the garden is meant to have a sense of renewal, so those who want to take a minute, and have a small moment of fresh air in a city of smog, this may just be the momentary escape necessary.

				<h3>Durbar Square</h3>
				<img src="images/ktm-5.jpg" alt="ktm-5">
				<p>
					The first thing that struck me about Durbar Square was all the pigeons; I realize that is an odd thing to notice about a place, but really, there were a lot. If you can look beyond that, you have a historical square with temples, shopping, history, an abundance of people and an exciting atmosphere. This is a playground for those with a short attention span. There is something in every direction and something for everyone to enjoy. There is great shopping and markets in the square. However you can visit a museum, a temple or even have a chance at spotting the Kumari gazing through her window. There is too much history to place into a single paragraph, so it may be easier to just go and visit and experience it for yourself.

				<h3>Delicious Food</h3>
				<img src="images/ktm-7.jpg" alt="ktm-7">
				<p>
					One thing I really love about travelling is the food that comes with it. I’m all for trying new things and getting a taste of the area I’m visiting; Kathmandu is no exception. I cannot recount how many momos I had (dumplings with various fillings), or dal baht and lets not even mention the array of curries. The food is rather good if you like eastern cuisine. It can definitely come with a kick, and may even have spices that you have never tasted, but many dishes off the menu will have you going for seconds. With a city like Kathmandu however, have no fear, if spice and new is not your cup of tea, there are many restaurants that serve western style foods; anything from French fries to eggs benedict. No one starves here.

				<h3>Monkey Temple</h3>
				<img src="images/ktm-6.jpg" alt="ktm-6">
				<p>
					The world heritage-listed Swayambhunath Temple is a short drive west of central Kathmandu. Monkeys strut their stuff all over Buddhist shrines and even have their own pool to freshen up in. At the top of the temple, there is a sweeping panoramic view of the city. The earthquake damaged some sections but it remains open to visitors.
